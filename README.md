<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

My main goal in doing this project was mainly to learn how to use the pygame library and develop my python skills. When choosing to create the famous snake game, I decided that I would add something more to this challenge, so I decided to put obstacles that appear every 2 apples eaten, giving an extra challenge to the players and also to me, who was programming.
